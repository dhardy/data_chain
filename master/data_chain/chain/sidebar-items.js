This object is verifiable if : The last validation contains the majority of current close group OR on network restart the nodes all must try and restart on previous names. They can continue any validation of the holder of a chain. This requires nodes to always restart as last ID and if there was no restart they are rejected at vault level. If there was a restart then the nodes should validate and continue. N:B this means all nodes can use a named directory for data store and clear if they restart as a new id. This allows clean-up of old data cache directories."],["NodeBlock","If data block then this is sent by any group member when data is `Put`, `Post` or `Delete`. If this is a link then it is sent with a `churn` event. A `Link` is a nodeblock that each member must send each other in times of churn. These will not accumulate but be `ManagedNode`  to `ManagedNode` messages in the routing layer"]]});
