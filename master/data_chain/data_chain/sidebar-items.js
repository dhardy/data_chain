This object is verifiable if : The last validation contains the majority of current close group OR on network restart the nodes all must try and restart on previous names. They can continue any validation of the holder of a chain. This requires nodes to always restart as last ID and if there was no restart they are rejected at vault level. If there was a restart then the nodes should validate and continue. N:B this means all nodes can use a named directory for data_store and clear if they restart as a new id. This allows clean-up of old data_cache directories."]]});
